10/8/19, 5:47 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: मन हारा तो रावण है , मन जीता तो राम।
मन ही मन में चल रहा देवासुर संग्राम।।

मन ही है  कैकई रानी ,मन ही मंथरा दासी है ।
मैला मन न कीजिये ये तो सत्यानासी है ।।

मन ही अंगद ,मन बजरंगी ,मन की शक्ति अपार।
मन में राम तो वानर भी कर जाये लंका पार ।।

 दंभी मन का,रावण मन का जिस दिन हो संहार।
विजयादशमी का ये पर्व, उस दिन हो साकार ।।

आप सभी को दशहरे की शुभकामनाएं।
विजयादशमी की अनंतानंत शुभकामनाएं

*Shhhh the secret santa is back*🎅 
It's the end of a decade!
 And Prayatna is ready for the festive season. HR department is organizing a secret santa activity 

*What's the concept of this celebration* ?

🎄 you will be informed about the person you need to be Secret Santa for.
🎄-This whole process is going to be anonymous and no body will know who's getting a gift for whom. 
🎄- The gift need not be expensive and should be of the cost ₹100-150 at max!
🎄 -You have to be creative on how you deliver the gifts so that identity of the gifting  person is unknown.

The venue and timing of this celebration will be disclosed soon. 

*Intreasted kindly insert their names here.
🎅 Saara Vashishtha

Want to have Fun😻...?

HR department has planned an official Trip
And we all are going to *The Grand Mechal* on *23 Feb 2020*.🤩

Yes the previous venue "chokhi dhani" has been changed to *"The grand machal"*, the reason for so, is that all of our members are not taking part because of the venue.

The entry fee is 125₹ per person! And 50₹* additional Travelling charges.
So approx *300-350* rupees in cash each one has to carry because we have to pay at that time for food for entry ticket and all

Entry fee includes several Indoor and outdoor games. Their is  big ground also for cricket, football, badminton,human chess etc!

Be on time guys ⏱
We are going to gather on an particular place before we starts the trip.
(So if you get late you have to travel alone😂)
1. 9:00 Vijay Nagar
2. 9:15 Palasia
3. 9:30 Footi kothi

(If you guys find any problem  contact Chaitanya/Tarun/Asmit)

6/20/20, 10:26 PM - Ankit: Seems great now♥️🔥
6/21/20, 9:16 PM - Ankit: *So guys before starting with the work I want to tell you about some of my plans*

1. What we want at Prayatna is to develop children as well as ourselves too.
So for this I have an idea that for Masti,jokes etc kind thing you can use hindi but while a formal discussion I want all of you to communicate in English.
As "Mistakes committed here will be just a lesson for our future," ,so don't be shy even if your communication skills aren't good enough ,we can surely try to make it perfect.

2. Whenever a point is being discussed or there's an announcement ,I want every member to either say a yes or no,agree ,disagree etc ,but no one should ignore the message and keep it just seen.

3. If you don't agree to a point you all have the right to disagree and keep your opinion . As in an organization view of every member is appreciated.

4. Members should try to initiate the various activites that will be conducted in the year. As taking a responsibility will make you more confident of yourself and will increase your leadership skills too..

*These Are some of the points that will help to improve our personality as well*

You can agree or disagree to any of the above points and can ask a question for any query !

*Surely it's not me,it's not you,it's US* 
Everybody matters♥️

Hoping to have a great year ahead♥️

7/7/20, 5:00 PM - Asmit Silhare Clg: Great🔥@917024198084
7/7/20, 5:04 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: I got an idea regarding promotion point we can organize live with different pages for example indori baate or indori graam or some other organisation for example robin hood army or some other through which they have large number of following. So if we will become guest on their page it will give some follower or other things also.
7/7/20, 5:24 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: We should have a clear objective behind organizing such events.
7/7/20, 5:25 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: And I think the former members won't approve for such events just for gaining a handful of followers.
7/7/20, 5:27 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: 💥
7/7/20, 5:39 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Yes we can discuss this thing.
7/7/20, 6:43 PM - Curiosity: It can be a great step
7/7/20, 6:43 PM - Curiosity: Yes
7/9/20, 11:16 AM - Ankit: More Suggestions/views over this  ?
7/11/20, 9:55 AM - Rishabh Sir Senior Clg: 🔴🔴🔴
7/11/20, 9:59 AM - Ankit: *So guys before starting with the work I want to tell you about some of my plans*

1. What we want at Prayatna is to develop children as well as ourselves too.
So for this I have an idea that for Masti,jokes etc kind thing you can use hindi but while a formal discussion I want all of you to communicate in English.
As "Mistakes committed here will be just a lesson for our future," ,so don't be shy even if your communication skills aren't good enough ,we can surely try to make it perfect.

2. Whenever a point is being discussed or there's an announcement ,I want every member to either say a yes or no,agree ,disagree etc ,but no one should ignore the message and keep it just seen.

3. If you don't agree to a point you all have the right to disagree and keep your opinion . As in an organization view of every member is appreciated.

4. Members should try to initiate the various activites that will be conducted in the year. As taking a responsibility will make you more confident of yourself and will increase your leadership skills too..

*These Are some of the points that will help to improve our personality as well*

You can agree or disagree to any of the above points and can ask a question for any query !

*Surely it's not me,it's not you,it's US* 
Everybody matters♥️

Hoping to have a great year ahead♥️
7/11/20, 9:59 AM - Ankit: *Read this again*
7/11/20, 10:00 AM - Ankit: Specially 2nd and 3rd point !
7/11/20, 10:05 AM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: We'll keep these things in mind. 💥🙌🏻
7/11/20, 10:08 AM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: I had put up the suggestion of organizing a webinar with any experienced teacher, in the meeting.
7/11/20, 10:09 AM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Totally agreed ! 👍
7/11/20, 10:12 AM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Agreed 👍🏻
7/11/20, 10:15 AM - Ankit: This will be great we have also received a review by a senior regarding the same,
We will try to do this once the session gets started
7/11/20, 10:32 AM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: Sure.
7/11/20, 10:39 AM - Curiosity: 👍🏻👍🏻
7/11/20, 10:47 AM - Khushi Junior Praytn: 👍🏻👍🏻
7/11/20, 11:26 AM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Agree sir 👍
7/11/20, 12:04 PM - Chaitanya Praytn: 👍🏻🔥
7/11/20, 8:27 PM - +91 78984 60968: agreed 👍
7/11/20, 8:42 PM - Ankit: I see everyone agreeing to my point but still no talks on this😅
7/11/20, 9:28 PM - Curiosity: I think if someone has some friends connected to such organisations so we can talk through them about the possibilities
7/12/20, 12:16 AM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: But we will talk to them if we all are agreeing on such stuf..
7/12/20, 12:16 AM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Otherwise it will make no sense.
7/12/20, 1:38 AM - Curiosity: It will decided by the OC I think
7/12/20, 1:44 AM - Amrik Clg: But then too you should discuss it over here because Each member's reviews are equally important 🔥💯
7/12/20, 10:10 AM - Ankit: Everything is decided by the members and *not the OC*. It is just carry forwarded by the OC .
That's why I said every member's opinion is important .My message even said view of every member is appreciated ..
7/12/20, 10:13 AM - Ankit: And guys seriously I am saying this now ,
*Don't ignore the messages* .
Even after repeated reminder I am seeing only 1 or 2 messages.
Even our former member Rishabh sir had to remind you of replying😅..
So please think about the ideas and say what you feel like , *Don't ignore the messages*
7/12/20, 10:14 AM - Ankit: And I don't want agreed reply on this ,
Rather discuss on the idea !
7/12/20, 1:39 PM - Curiosity: So we can try to approach them
7/12/20, 1:40 PM - Curiosity: The other organisations members*
7/12/20, 1:41 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Yess and also other pages like indori baate indori gram also
7/12/20, 1:46 PM - Curiosity: So any one here has some connection over their?
7/12/20, 1:49 PM - Ankit: This message was deleted
7/12/20, 1:49 PM - Ankit: I have forwarded idea to PR head,
Idea will be discussed there too,
We will proceed when we all agree
7/12/20, 1:58 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Yess we have contacted them when we are planning for open mic they have information about us.
7/12/20, 10:36 PM - Ankit: I can only see @918358086245 @917024198084 @919425092037 discussing over the thing 😅 even after reading the messages ..
Guys if this continues we will never be able to do something fast ....
7/12/20, 10:38 PM - Ankit: Guys putting a thought won't take you more than 5 minutes I guess, you can give 5 minutes to this from your 24 hours 🔥
7/13/20, 12:51 PM - Khushi Junior Praytn: Yes sir I agree with this idea 💯
7/13/20, 12:55 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: My friend is in robin hood army , i can talk to her about this idea !
7/13/20, 1:03 PM - Ankit: @919425092037 You too are in Robin hood army ??
7/13/20, 2:58 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Yesss
7/13/20, 11:29 PM - Rishabh Sir Senior Clg: Guys I appreciate your spirit of promoting prayatna. 

But at the same time, it's our duty to ensure we are working double the amount of dedication for the kids. Lately, our club has been emphasising more on promotional/fundraising activities rather than the kids.

I know it's not possible right now to do much about the school or kids. But the HR dept is capable of inspiring other members to make a conscious decision and balance btw both the things. 

I am not discouraging the idea of promoting. A better reach helps. But at the same time, we are here for the children first.

*Ask yourself when you're in the class, are you giving your best?*
7/13/20, 11:29 PM - Rishabh Sir Senior Clg: This might  sound like too much gyaan, still I wanted to say this.
7/13/20, 11:30 PM - Rishabh Sir Senior Clg: I don't want our club to be like the other ones, who brag about their work more than they spend their time doing it.
7/13/20, 11:34 PM - Ankit: I agree too much with your point sir 🔥
7/13/20, 11:36 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: This message was deleted
7/13/20, 11:36 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Totally agreed and got your point.
7/13/20, 11:37 PM - Ankit: We will surely try to come up with ideas that are children centric
7/13/20, 11:38 PM - Rishabh Sir Senior Clg: I have faith in you guys. 
:)
7/14/20, 12:00 AM - Curiosity: Yes sir we got your point
7/14/20, 12:04 AM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Sure sir we'll look forward to that.
7/14/20, 9:51 AM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Sir we surely try to give our best for the children...
After all we all are here first for the children 😍
7/14/20, 10:07 AM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: Yes Sir, we'll take care of this.
7/14/20, 10:40 AM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Yes sir ! We all are completed with your words💯
7/14/20, 11:54 AM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Sir when we had calls form the members for the feedback survey that time many of the seniors suggested for adding more subject like GK or maths like that ... so can we work on it?????
7/14/20, 1:30 PM - Curiosity: Their was a discussion about maths that not all the members will be able to teach maths properly.... But we can further more discuss about it...
And about GK I think it shld be included.
7/14/20, 1:31 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: I think GK is included in interactive sessions.
7/14/20, 1:34 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Also milan sir told that the teachers ll become independent of those subjects and won't teach anymore properly, already they wants us to teach em everything. We can but it'll affect their attitude.
7/14/20, 1:36 PM - Curiosity: 💯
7/14/20, 1:40 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: We can teach them gk other then their course means some genral things but relating them with their syllabus
7/14/20, 1:42 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Along with this we can  focus on their personality development class too
7/14/20, 1:46 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: 🤝🏻🤝🏻
7/14/20, 2:24 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Yess we have 2 days friday and Saturday ...we can take interactive session one day and other this extra subject other day in place of interactive session
7/14/20, 2:51 PM - Chaitanya Praytn: Actually the new syllabus that is being designed by teaching department consists of both English + Computer this time.
 
Also for other subjects like Mathematics and General Knowledge RnD department is thinking of some ideas, techniques, methods by which we could teach them these subjects.
7/14/20, 3:39 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Yes in indirect ways it'll be beneficial.
7/14/20, 4:21 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Can we replace interactive with personel development and g.k !?
7/14/20, 4:24 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: Ridam, interactive sessions already include General Science. All we can do is add personal development topics. 

Rest, I think we should discuss with the Teaching Department.
7/14/20, 4:47 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: But the interactive topics are decided by the respective person, we shld put Personality development separately.
7/14/20, 4:53 PM - Ankit: Adding / designing of syllabus is the task of r&d and teaching department .
We can forward this idea to them ,
They will discuss on it .
We tried teaching GK to kids but they show very less Intrest to it.
They show interest towards history,world wars,anything that arouses patriotic feeling,anything like this related to India.
They are not interested in other GK topics.
And already interactive topics covers a little of them. Parth once taught about Kargil war and student showed a great response .

So discussing on topics, Gk etc is done by r&d and teaching.
7/14/20, 4:54 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Yup 🤞
7/14/20, 5:13 PM - Ankit: Anshu told me that many new things are discussed alongwith GK ,which will be out in the group as soon as it is finalized .
7/14/20, 5:48 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Yes but i mean topics of G.K from their syllabus
7/14/20, 5:48 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: 👍🏻👍🏻
7/14/20, 7:00 PM - Curiosity: 👍🏻👍🏻

7/20/20, 3:05 PM - Ankit: Good afternoon everyone,
We have got 2 works more to do in the upcoming days 
1) As we know that currently there's no interaction between members and due to which there's inactivity everywhere ,so we have got a  suggestion for doing some interacting activity to accelerate the activity back..
So we need to discuss upon what to do and how to do .

2) It is decided that we will be giving a certificate to some members who left due to some issues ,keeping in mind some criteria that is essential for the certificate ..

So we need to discuss upon the first point and we have to start our work on the second
7/20/20, 3:14 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: On which point we have to discuss first ?
7/20/20, 3:37 PM - Curiosity: I think on certificate
7/20/20, 3:39 PM - Ankit: Um wait
7/20/20, 3:39 PM - Ankit: I will brief you all once
7/20/20, 4:02 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Yess sir
7/20/20, 4:04 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: 1st point k liyeh games suggest kr skte hai
7/20/20, 4:23 PM - Ankit: So basically what we need to do is we will be preparing certificate for those who left and match the required criteria for certificate ,
I will be providing you the names ,
We just have to prepare an E-certificate (seeing the current situation,not possible to give a hard copy).The certificate was already prepared earlier by Chaitanya we just need to add names of the members on certificate .
7/20/20, 4:23 PM - Ankit: We have to discuss on interactive activity that can be productful as well as increase the interaction
7/20/20, 4:24 PM - Ankit: We have nothing to discuss on certificate ,
We just need to add names
7/20/20, 4:44 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: We can arrange something but games are  a bit messy if u have noticed it during farewell.
For the certificate, we need to discuss the members first, we shld start by suggesting names.
7/20/20, 4:48 PM - Ankit: Yes
7/20/20, 4:48 PM - Curiosity: Is this same for the terminated members and the members who left themselves.
7/20/20, 4:49 PM - Curiosity: ?*
7/20/20, 4:49 PM - Ankit: No there will not be any certificate for those who are terminated
7/20/20, 4:50 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: We cannot provide certificate to all of them who left i think so
7/20/20, 4:52 PM - Ankit: Yes ,
We will provide to those whose record have been mentioned in the HR annual report .
We have a record of people upto 2018-19 ,
I will look it up and tell you once
7/20/20, 4:53 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: But we have to consider the reason also.
7/20/20, 4:54 PM - Curiosity: +1
7/20/20, 4:54 PM - Ankit: We know people who have been terminated and left with the reasons from the year we are working so it will not be a problem
7/20/20, 4:54 PM - Ankit: We will consider the document just for a recheck
7/20/20, 4:54 PM - Ankit: That's why I said
7/20/20, 4:55 PM - Ankit: I will give you the names
7/20/20, 4:55 PM - Ankit: You just have to make the certificate
7/20/20, 4:56 PM - Ankit: And maybe I misunderstood it ,reason for what??
7/20/20, 5:08 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Actually me abhi sbke reasons hme nhi pta he kisne kya diye the to 1 baar hme check krna chahiye ki kisi ka reason useless type means bahane jesa to nhi he
7/20/20, 5:10 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: Right!
7/20/20, 5:25 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Yes !
7/20/20, 5:37 PM - Ankit: Yes we will definitely see that
7/20/20, 6:08 PM - Chaitanya Praytn: I've sent a certificate on HR documents . 
The task is quite simple. We just need to change the name, branch and duration they've served praytana . 

Also for digital signatures we'll contact Gaurav Sir.
7/20/20, 6:10 PM - Chaitanya Praytn: Don't open in WPS office.
 The alignment automatically changes in WPS office. (Also China ka app unistall kro 🚩)
7/20/20, 6:22 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: 🚩🚩🚩
7/20/20, 6:28 PM - Ankit: Yeah🔥
7/20/20, 6:36 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Haaa certificate me sirf kuch changes hi krne hai ..vo to easily ho jaiga
7/20/20, 6:37 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: But activities k liyeh kya kya decide kre ?
7/20/20, 7:03 PM - Ankit: Wahi sochooo
7/20/20, 7:03 PM - Ankit: Kuch achaaaaa
7/20/20, 7:04 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Other than games.?
7/20/20, 7:04 PM - Ankit: Yes it could be anything
7/20/20, 7:04 PM - Ankit: Target is to accelerate activity that's it
7/20/20, 8:04 PM - Khushi Junior Praytn: I have an idea! 
Interaction of 50-60 members together will create a mess so we can target those people who have least interaction or not at all. 
We can give them tasks or ask them to tell about their journey or ask them some questions like " What is the funniest thing happened in school? " Or let other members if they wanna ask some questions to them. We can do this in a creative way like when can prepare chits of their names and pick out randomly so that no one will offend.
7/20/20, 8:07 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Nice idea i agree with you but baki members ko koi objection ni ho jai bss
7/20/20, 8:08 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Noice🤞🏻😁🔥
7/20/20, 8:08 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: We can also add some active members randomly.
7/20/20, 8:08 PM - Chaitanya Praytn: Great idea khushi ! 🔥👍🏻

But what i think is we should involve all the members rather than the ones who have less interaction .
7/20/20, 8:09 PM - Ankit: Yesss
7/20/20, 8:09 PM - Ankit: It's a great idea
7/20/20, 8:09 PM - Ankit: @919479771677 if you can modify it then it will be great
7/20/20, 8:09 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Also we have did same things of question so we have to think other then this.
7/20/20, 8:09 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Yess
7/20/20, 8:12 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: We can give them task by asking questions or anything like this with active members ! This will involve all the members i think !
7/20/20, 8:13 PM - Amrik Clg: Nice Idea 🔥🙌🏻
7/20/20, 8:16 PM - Amrik Clg: But it needs some modification because our target is to involve all Members 🔥💯
7/20/20, 8:19 PM - Amrik Clg: We can target those people who dont have interaction with each other.
7/20/20, 8:24 PM - Khushi Junior Praytn: Sure sir I will modify it!
7/20/20, 8:25 PM - Ankit: Great🔥🔥🔥🔥
7/20/20, 8:25 PM - Khushi Junior Praytn: Yes I was just a example we can make it more creative
7/20/20, 8:25 PM - Khushi Junior Praytn: 💯💯
7/20/20, 8:27 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Yep🤞💥
7/20/20, 8:31 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: ⚫For activities -
         We can try tongue twisters with members in hindi or english ..yeh abhi tk hua bhi nahi hai and funny bhi hoga
7/20/20, 8:31 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: We'll target inactive members to communicate or doing task with other (active ) members !
7/20/20, 8:32 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Nice 🙌🏻
7/20/20, 8:32 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Hum inke sath hi kr skte h tongue twister wala
7/20/20, 8:33 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Exactly !
7/20/20, 8:34 PM - Ankit: Games will be quite messy ,we saw in farewell
7/20/20, 8:34 PM - Ankit: Games were conducted for 14 people yet it felt like
7/20/20, 8:34 PM - Ankit: A mess
7/20/20, 8:35 PM - Ankit: According to me
7/20/20, 8:39 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: It's a game i guess😄
7/20/20, 8:39 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Agree.
7/20/20, 8:40 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Randomly.*
7/20/20, 8:41 PM - Amrik Clg: Cool!

7/20/20, 8:53 PM - Ankit: Haan bdaaaa acha lgra h aj
7/20/20, 8:54 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Yess whatever😂
7/20/20, 8:56 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Hmare pass bohot members hai to hum members to divide kr skte hai ...
Usse game or activity bhi achche se ho skti hai and sare members include bhi ho jaenge
7/20/20, 8:57 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: But again issue is that we have only a single platform i.e. Zoom 🤣
7/20/20, 8:59 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Hum meeting ko ek hi rekhenge but different activities or gmes k liyeh chance by chance different members ko include krenge
7/20/20, 8:59 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Apprx whats is the ratio for division ?
7/20/20, 9:17 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
7/20/20, 9:18 PM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: Nhi baaki log bht hi zyada bore ho jate h.
7/20/20, 9:28 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: Please try to avoid zoom or else like this kyu k kaai baar aisa hota h log available nhi reh pate , yaa khi baar aisa hota h log bore hojate h  . Network problem or itne time continue on phone ! Isnt quite difficult?
7/20/20, 9:38 PM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: +1
7/20/20, 9:39 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: What will be the alternative then?
7/20/20, 9:45 PM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: We can try skype
7/21/20, 12:06 AM - Khushi Junior Praytn: We can create group of 4 members (2 active, 2 inactive) and give them task 1 which they have to do together.
Next we will reshuffle the team and and again will form the group of 4 members and give them task 2.
In this way the interaction among the members will be more  (one member will interact with many members) 
When all this is over we will conduct a meeting in which we will tell the result and will ask each members to tell the positive points of other fellow members.
7/21/20, 12:17 AM - Ankit: Tasks like?
7/21/20, 12:31 AM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: Sounds better
7/21/20, 12:52 AM - Devansh Verma Junior Prytn: 🤞🏻🤞🏻
7/21/20, 9:08 AM - Khushi Junior Praytn: Sir haven't thought of that but it should involve the team work and all the 4 members. 
Suggestions are most welcomed!
7/21/20, 9:20 AM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: 👍
7/21/20, 9:31 AM - Ridam Choudhary Praytn: We can do the task like treasure hunt because in this game interaction with different members took place as we saw in farewell

7/25/20, 9:34 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: Well, here's a suggestion. Why not keep Prayatna members updated with such stuff! This can be through Prayatna's social media handel. This may also deal with lack of activeness among members now-a-days.
7/25/20, 9:59 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: <Media omitted>

7/25/20, 11:20 PM - Morya Agrawal Praytn Junior: When you read such things regularly, you don't forget them. Also, it can help R&D to structure their learning wisely.
7/26/20, 9:49 PM - Yashika Sharma Prytn Junior: This message was deleted
7/26/20, 9:52 PM - Ankit: This is the documented form of the review we got from our former seniors ..

So we have organized an online game of  *tambola/ housie* this weekend because at the end
*Its not the place that matters , its the bond which we share with each other.*

So take some time from your schedule,  keep all worries aside and be ready to enjoy the fun of this  small virtual get together.

*Date  : 16th August*
*Time :*
*your tambola/housie tickets will be provided to you before time*

Members can add their names in the list.

Even Milan sir joined the game for a short duration to encourage us as there were very less participants ..
If you aren't able to come ,
You should say that before so that we can postpone it as per your availability😅 ..
Stay cheered up else everything would just be boring ! If you are not participating in such activities than you can never be as comfortable with all the members as we are today with our senior members ..
Hope to see more participation next time !

For the website we are writing about the departments too,
So what we need is something about HR department,
Eg What is HR dept ,what are the works of HR dept etc..We need to do this ASAP..

A form will be circulated asking members for their photos for the website ,I know earlier it had been asked too but many members haven't uploaded *photo with kids* on the drive,
So every member should fill this form without delay so that our website can be completed asap🌟 .

10/19/20, 9:58 AM - Asmit Silhare Clg: Point no. 1???
10/19/20, 10:02 AM - Asmit Silhare Clg: What about the feedback calls we were supposed to do that in mid of October
10/19/20, 10:20 AM - Ankit: Tcs is conducting it's placement in October,
Plus many other companies are having their off campuses hackathons tech exams etc ..
So it's a bit difficult for me to co-ordinate in October so I thought to conduct it after nqt i.e.26 october
10/19/20, 10:25 AM - Asmit Silhare Clg: I completely understand this but if this year is not a pandemic one HR supposed to organize Recruitment, invocation,diya selling ...etc then how we manage???
10/19/20, 10:26 AM - Asmit Silhare Clg: And ankit in previous meeting we came to the conclusion that if this type of situation came you need to tell this thing to everyone
10/19/20, 11:04 AM - Aayushi Gurjar Praytn Junior: Yes sir
10/19/20, 12:35 PM - Ankit: Asmit managing things virtually is a bit tough then managing thing in person or by being at place !
You are busy with your CAT so you might not be involved this much but we are facing lot of issues managing things virtually !
+
It's a pandemic companies aren't recruiting so every final year student is trying to get placed during this month as we don't have any hopes of recruitments till December then.
And every final year students is busy with placement so I don't think so that they are able to give a proper feedback call,as it is difficult to manage time for a call and that too we need a elaborate feedback so waiting till 26 will not be an issue I guess
10/19/20, 12:36 PM - Ankit: Student*
10/19/20, 12:42 PM - Ankit: Yes I agree I should have told this !
